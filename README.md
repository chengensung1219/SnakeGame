# Overview

I am trying to learn more new programming languages. The reason that I chose to learn C++ this time is that I want to develop a game that uses Unreal Engine 5. For this goal, I need to learn C++, before I learn about Unreal Engine 5.

This is a game software. It will score the score and the snake will be longer when the user controls the snake to touch the food. Also, every 3 times the snake eats food, the snake will grow a little longer. 

The purpose of writing this software is to help me well prepare for game development and use the language I just learned to build software to allow users to play and enjoy.

# Development Environment

The tool that I going to use is Xcode which allows mac users to write C++ programs. I will also use YouTube and ChatGPT to help me answer those questions that I might not know.

This is a C++ game, so I will be using Xcode with C++ on it to develop the app. Also, I will also be using Raylib library to help me for the basic game framework for snake game.
